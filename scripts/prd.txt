# EduChain: Blockchain-based Certificate Verification System

## Project Overview
EduChain is a secure and decentralized certificate verification system built on blockchain technology. The system enables educational institutions to issue digital certificates and allows stakeholders to verify their authenticity using blockchain.

## Core Features

### Blockchain Core
- Implement block structure with hash calculation and mining capabilities
- Create blockchain management system for certificate storage and validation
- Develop certificate creation and verification mechanisms
- Ensure chain integrity and immutability

### Backend System
- Build Express.js server with RESTful API endpoints
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Integrate MongoDB for user data storage
- Set up Winston logger for system monitoring
- Create PDF certificate generator using PDFKit
- Handle certificate operations (issue, verify, search)

### Frontend Interface
- Develop React-based user interface with Material-UI
- Create certificate form with validation
- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
- Build navigation and dashboard components
- Display blockchain explorer and certificate verification status

### Security Features
- JWT-based authentication system
- API rate limiting
- Helmet security headers
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive error handling
- Secure data storage and transmission

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- Node.js and Express.js for backend
- React and Material-UI for frontend
- MongoDB for data storage
- PDFKit for certificate generation
- Blockchain-specific libraries
- Security middleware (helmet, rate-limit)
- JWT for authentication

### Architecture
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- RESTful API architecture
- Secure blockchain implementation
- Scalable database design
- Responsive frontend components

## Security Requirements
- Secure user authentication
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Secure certificate storage and verification
- Access control and role-based permissions

## Deliverables
1. Complete blockchain implementation
2. Backend API with all required endpoints
3. Frontend user interface
4. Security features implementation
5. System documentation
6. Testing suite
